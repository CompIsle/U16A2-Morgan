## D2 Evaluate the impact of methodologies used to plan, develop and refine object-oriented program solutions

Agile methodologies are flexible and allow developers to create software in whatever way is suited to the circumstances. In contrast to the waterfall method, which can be too rigid and reduce creativity, an agile method allows you to shift strategies quickly without disrupting the flow of a project.

The drawback of agile methodologies is that, in a team, they require constant communication and necessitate strong teamwork. The emphasis placed on this makes large scale projects unrealistic. Agile methods suit small scale development much better than large, long term projects, making it suitable for this project. [Reference](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp3kd2p/revision/4)

For this assignment, I have followed this methodology. In the planning stage, I defined the project scope by clearly outlining the goals and deliverables of the project. I listed all the features in my data dictionaries. With each sprint during the development phase, I achieved these milestones and made necessary adjustments as I reflected on the code. Using feedback gathered, I refined the code and made continuous improvements. Not having to abide by a rigid plan gave me flexibility in making sure that each feature was fully functional and responsive before moving on to the next sprint.

## D3 Time management

To plan my time in the design and development of this project, I set goals to complete each week. To help me manage this, I created a Gantt chart that I could follow; having a visual representation of the duration allocated to each goal made it easier for me to stay on track and make progress. I took a proactive approach by setting achievable goals for each day of design and development and breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks in a logical flow. I ensured that I allocated realistic amounts of time to each task so that I didnâ€™t overload myself but kept a steady pace while developing the programs.

## D3 Self management and individual responsibility

I have shown individual responsibility by seeking feedback from others to improve my code. By embracing this feedback and adapting the design and code accordingly, the final products better met the client requirements.
When taking reviews from others, I had them send messages that I could screenshot and use in order to ensure the feedback was accurate. I took individual responsibility by making sure that each of these points of feedback were addressed, and by documenting the changes that were made in response to them.
